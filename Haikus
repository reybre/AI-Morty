Leaves fall to the ground
Surprisingly gracefully
Unlike your dancing
I am not good at
haikus is this how you do
them im confused, apple
My pokemon rock
the socks right off of all your
pokemon, boom boom
I love love love love
love love love love love love love
love love love your face
You step out into
the rain with your pretty eyes
Looking to the clouds (I dont know what that means, interpret that how you will)
The amazing thing
About you is the way that
The stars get jealous
When I see your face
looking at me I feel
so happy and strong
Is it weird that all
I want is to see if you
can get mad schwifty
Albino Giraffes
Dont like it when you tell them
that their white, racist
I want to hold
your face against my face
uncomfortably
Help im trapped in a
python program send help and
also snacks like cookies
woogly woogly woo
This is a rhyming haiku
And now its over
If I had to sing
To save your life from danger
I'd do it poorly
Woof woof woof woof woof
Bark bark bark bark bark bark bark
Bow wow wow wow dog
Bloop bloop i'm a fish
Swimming around and around
Oh look! Shiny thing!
The hardest part of
making haikus is counting
out how many syl-
If I could count out
How many ways I love you
It would be alot
